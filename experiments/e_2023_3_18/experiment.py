'''
Tasks:
- make matching pursuit model easily save-able (PyTorch module)
- transform point clouds for transformer (or other GNN) consumption
- transformer training objective (correct atom, relative time, relative magnitude)
- greedy point cloud alignment and loss
- batch HPSS algorithm
- set autoencoder, using alignment loss
