The previous experiment feels very close, but the combination of MSE and adversarial loss seems to be keeping the network from learning faithful reproductions.  For today, I'll try out a classical, conditional GAN scenario to see what we come up with.

Other, related things to try in this iteration:

# Unconditioned GAN
Mode collapse

# Adversarial Latent Autoencoder
Generator just got really loud
