Using an over-parameterized, "too-easy" network with a sparsity penalty
as a bottleneck seems to be the way to proceed.

# Things to Try

- remove reverb
- higher base resonance
- visualize impulse curves
- gaps in noise filters (learn them instead?)
- lateral competition in sparse code
- when not using impulse/resonance convolution, impulse should drive resonance energy
- hpss loss
