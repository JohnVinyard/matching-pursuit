Trying once more for a graph-based representation.  Getting the sparse model
to take advantage of resonance and respect cause and effect is my goal

Sept 4th experiment has a decent resonance model already, but takes the approach
of using context to generate a dictionary which is then convolved with the sparse representation

instead, the one_hot vectors + context should be used to generate all resonance model parameters
