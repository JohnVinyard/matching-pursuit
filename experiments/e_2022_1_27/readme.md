Returning to the experiment from 1-23-2022, which produced very good renderings of the audio.  
The experiment from 1-24-2022 *seemed* to show that only the noise model was contributing;  once the
noise model had much poorer frequency resolution, the reconstructions were much worse.

The other possibility is that good frequency resolution for the noise model is *necessary* for the
sine oscillator model to learn.

This experiment seeks to answer this question definitively by allowing separate listening to the 
noise and oscillator components.
