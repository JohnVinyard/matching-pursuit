In this experiment, we'll explore whether learnable resonances improve the situation with violins

Things to try:
- STFT resonance
- ~~simple conv event generator~~ - FAIL, I can't bear going back to this sound
- "classic" resonance model with learnable resonances
- bring back noisemodel, rather than the simple model I have now
- try a NERF-type model
