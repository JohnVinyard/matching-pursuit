Does the atoms experiment work any better (or at all) with a simplified setup that includes:
- no multi-resolution transform
- simple magnitude spectrogram as target/loss

# Conclusion

The noise is "good enough" so the unconstrained sine parameters fade to silence.  Interestingly,
the autoencoder learns pretty precise, noisy renderings with good timing.
