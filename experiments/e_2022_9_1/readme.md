Aspects to try out:

# Sparsity
- vector sparsity
- elementwise sparsity

# Generator
- DDSP
- Conv upscale
- NERF
- Multi-band
- Transfer function event for each "on" neuron


# Experiments

## Element-wise sparse with DDSP Generator
This did not work out great, muddy, un-musical

## Element-wise sparse with Conv Upscale Generator
choppy/bumpy, very unpleasant sounding
