# TODO

## Experiment
- lose the context vector entirely;  everything depends on the event vector
- bump up sparsity penalty a bit
- try out other resonance model, just for fun


## Report UI

- use audio buffers rather than audio elements to play individual sounds
- show low-res view of audio "channels", not just event positions
- update architecture diagram



## Negative Results
- try out info/entropy-based loss again and see where it gets us
