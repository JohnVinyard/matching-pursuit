Time to resolve the problems that are leaving me _just_ short of some really gorgeous reconstructions:

- different frequencies need to decay at different rates
- more frequency resolution
- more time variability (more than 4 resonance choices)


# Ideas

- simply double density of resonances and double number of resonances chosen
- f0 + octave-based resonances
- NERF-based generator
- Oscillator bank + noise generator


# Things that might help
- denser resonances - This definitely helps!
- more resonances to fade between - This definitely helps!
- higher-res noise envelope
- noise is its own resonance chain
- higher time resolution mixture
- higher-frequency resolution loss
- relu in mix
