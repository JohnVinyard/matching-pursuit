Create two loss branches:
    - a loss for events given the benefit of the doubt about positioning and amplitude
    - a loss for positioning and amplitude, given the best known/possible values


Things to try next:

- one channel at a time (analysis in the loop)
- with sparse featuremap rather than vector events
