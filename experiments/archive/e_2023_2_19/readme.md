# NERF study:

- can I learn very long signals with NERF/SIREN?
- does categorical encoding work better than continuous values?
- can I learn a hypernetwork (low-rank approximation) to produce the same signal?
- can I learn hypernetworks that can learn many signals?
- Can I learn a NERF/SIREN network to represent 2D or 3D sound in a room/space?
- Can I learn a network to output sparse events rather than dense samples?

# Other things:
- Room simulator
- patch-based sample loss
