Big discovery from yesterday seems to be that the intense bottleneck I was applying when reduing the periodicity dimension was just too severe.

Reducing bands with 3d convolutions seems to work much better.

Today, can I get around the exploding generator problem and return to the autoencoder setting using
an adversarial feature loss?
