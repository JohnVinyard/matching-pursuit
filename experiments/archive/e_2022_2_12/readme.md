So far, tweaks to the model haven't yielded any drastic changes.  Yesterday's experiment resulted in worse loss than the day prior.

Today, I will try to return to abs or **2 as the amp nonlinearity, as well as ?

Honestly, I don't have a strong hypothesis or direction today.

Two major changes from yesterday:
    - noise frequency resolution increases in higher bands
    - frequencies in lowest band shouldn't start below 20hz


# Conclusion

This is capturing musical lines and muscal instrument textures quite well.  
Another good jumping off point!
