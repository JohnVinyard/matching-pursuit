Can the model make do with fewer frequencies?  There seems to be a fair amount of "crowding" in the lower bands.

# Conclusion
This is the best auto-encoding scenario so far.  Lowering the density of oscillators seems to have really helped!  I consider this experiment
a success, and this model to be a jumping-off point for future exploration.
