Given the results of the previous experiment, it seems that we're able to learn pretty good renderings using filtered noise.
This covers the neural place encoding, I think, but not the spike-timing encoding.  However, maybe we can leverage the
good "seeking" behavior of the noise.  Once the filter-bandwidth for the noise becomes narrow enough, maybe we can
blend in a sine wave at that center frequency?
