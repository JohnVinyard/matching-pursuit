Yesterday's experiment was mostly a success, with the caveat that the noise model 
faded into silence, leaving the oscillators to fill the gap, producing unsatisfying,
fake-sounding video-gamey reproductions.

Today's theory is that squaring the noise model output is the culprit here.

# Conclusion
The results were the same as yesterday's experiment.  Squaring the noise model
was not the culprit.
